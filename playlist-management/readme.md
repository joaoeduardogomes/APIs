# Playlists managament **ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸**

A project made for practicing the use of NodeJS and Express for API creation.

## Project Goal

The goal was to creat a API that could manage playlists by creating a new playlist, delete an existent playlist, update the playlist data, add a new song to a playlist and remove an existing song from a playlist. We also can create and add a new song to the list of songs. However, a method to update or delete a song was not created.

## Tecnologies

**Back-end:** Node, Express

## Lessons learned & challenges

With this project I was able to practice the MVC model for manage an API.

## How to use

For trying this API, you could test its usability by running the server and trying the specific URL for each method.
